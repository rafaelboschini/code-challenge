# Boskini Reddit Client v1.0

This is an example of a responsive Reddit client made in React with Redux.

### 🌎 Live demo:
http://boskini-reddit-reader.herokuapp.com/

### 👍 Features:
- Fetch the last 50 posts and save them in local storage
- Dismiss all and reload data
- Share button
- Layout responsive
- Dark mode
- support image and videos

### 🛎️ Some attention points:
It took 23h to do, maybe if we change redux for Hooks or stream builder(rxjs) this time can be reduced.

I choose to use styled components because I want to demonstrate the rawest as possible, but if we use some framework like tailwindcss, the development time can be reduce more.

### 🔌 Data source
I choose a live API to fetch data, this makes it much more fun.
